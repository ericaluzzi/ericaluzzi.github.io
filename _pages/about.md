I am a geologist, I graduated in Rome, Italy, at Università La Sapienza, and then I moved to Bremen, Germany, for my PhD on Planetary Geology. In Bremen I experienced all sort of emotions: from discovering a new culture to partecipating to the most stimulating projects I could have ever imagined at that point. I was part of the ESA Analog1 experiment, I studied in detail chaotic terrains on Mars and then floor-fractured craters on the Moon, I worked with international scientists under the roof of the PLANMAP project, and I got into a wonderful and proactive community of early careers within Europlanet. 
What's next? I am currently looking for a post-doc position since I will defend my PhD thesis on May, 2021. 

A dear friend once told me that the only way to grow was to come out from the comfort zone. I believe these words saved me and kept me motivated, and I am now ready for new adventures and for developing all my ideas for future projects.
